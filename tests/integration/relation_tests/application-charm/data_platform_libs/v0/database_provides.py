"""Relation provider side abstraction for database relation.

This library is a uniform interface to a selection of common database
metadata, with added custom events that add convenience to database management,
and methods to set the application related data.

Following an example of using the DatabaseRequestedEvent, in the context of the
database charm code:

```python
from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.database_provides import DatabaseProvides

class SampleCharm(CharmBase):

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)

        # Charm events defined in the database provides charm library.
        self.provided_database = DatabaseProvides(self, relation_name="database")
        self.framework.observe(self.provided_database.on.database_requested,
            self._on_database_requested)

        # Database generic helper
        self.database = DatabaseHelper()

    def _on_database_requested(self, event: DatabaseRequestedEvent) -> None:
        # Handle the event triggered by a new database requested in the relation

        # Retrieve the database name using the charm library.
        db_name = event.database

        # generate a new user credential
        username = self.database.generate_user()
        password = self.database.generate_password()

        # set the credentials for the relation
        self.provided_database.set_credentials(event.relation.id, username, password)

        # set other variables for the relation event.set_tls("False")
```
