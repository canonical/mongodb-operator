# Charmed MongoDB tutorial

The Charmed MongoDB Operator delivers automated operations management from [day 0 to day 2](https://codilime.com/blog/day-0-day-1-day-2-the-software-lifecycle-in-the-cloud-age/) on the [MongoDB Community Edition](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) document database. It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform [on top of Juju](https://juju.is/). As a first step this tutorial shows you how to get Charmed MongoDB up and running, but the tutorial does not stop there. Through this tutorial you will learn a variety of operations, everything from adding replicas to advanced operations such as enabling Transcript Layer Security (TLS). In this tutorial we will walk through how to:
- Set up your environment using LXD and Juju.
- Deploy MongoDB using a single command.
- Access the admin database directly.
- Add high availability with replication.
- Change the admin password.
- Automatically create MongoDB users via Juju relations. 
- Enable secure transactions with TLS.

While this tutorial intends to guide and teach you as you deploy Charmed MongoDB, it will be most beneficial if you already have a familiarity with: 
- Basic terminal commands.
- MongoDB concepts such as replication and users.
