## Charmed MongoDB Documentation 

The Charmed MongoDB Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [MongoDB Community Edition](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) document database. It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform on top of juju.

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database application. It stores its data with JSON-like documents creating a flexible experience for users; with easy to use data aggregation for data analytics. It is a distributed database, so vertical and horizontal scaling come naturally.

This operator charm deploys and operates MongoDB on physical or virtual machines. It offers features such as replication, TLS, password rotation, and easy to use integration with applications. The Charmed MongoDB Operator meets the need of deploying MongoDB in a structured and consistent manner while allowing the user flexibility in configuration. It simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of MongoDB in production at scale in a reliable way.
